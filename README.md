# _Prose_

This is a framework I use for vibe coding.

## Core Philosophy

**Coding** is the art of communicating instructions to machines--so it makes sense that that LLMs can translate English into code better than me. After all, [the transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)--the cornerstone component in large language model (LLM) architecture that enables long-range pattern recognition--was originally created for translation tasks. Translating English to code is probably easier than translating English to French.

**Programming** is the art of building your ideas into virtual systems. Programming demands innotative ideas, good taste, and the ability to adapt to new contexts that lie outside of the distribution of an LLM's training data. I don't expect LLM-based AI agents to be better at programming than me in the near-term. LLMs can abstract ideas, think logically, and translate robustly--but my neural network (i.e., brain) is equipped for the complex problems posed by natural selection. Its architecture has been tuned by a stochastic algorithm that has sustained life for billions of years and created intelligence from nothing. I will continue adding creative and computational value as a programmer. Probably.

_Prose_ frameworks facillitates the AI agent's role as the coder and my role as the programmer by helping me:
- Express my ideas, taste, and context to the agent
- Validate and tweak the agent's trajectory
- Maintain awareness of my project's evolving concepts and codebase
- Iterate faster

_Prose_ is not dogmatic; tailor it for your own style and use cases. Here's a starting point:

## The Workflow

_Prose_ involves two types of markdown documents:

- **Designs** are authoritative over the project's desired state. They capture my ideas and intent through medium to high-level specifications.
- **Plans** describe actionable phases that take the project from its current state to the desired state.

And uses two types of agents:

- **Architect** drafts design documents and plans based on your high-level intent and specifications.
- **Programmer** implements plans. 

When you want to express your idea or intent, submit a new prompt to
