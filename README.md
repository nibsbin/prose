## Ramble on AI Coding

**Coding** is the art of communicating instructions to machines--so it makes sense that that LLMs can translate English into code better than I do. After all, [the transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)--the cornerstone component in large language model (LLM) architecture that enables long-range pattern recognition--was originally created for translation tasks. Translating English to code is probably easier than translating English to French.

**Programming** is the art of building your ideas into virtual systems. Programming demands innotative ideas, good taste, and adapting to new contexts that lie outside the distribution of an LLM's training data. I don't expect LLM-based AI agents to be better at programming than me in the near-term. LLMs can abstract ideas, think logically, and translate robustly--but my neural network (i.e., brain) is equipped for the complex problems posed by natural selection pressures. Its architecture architecture has been tuned by a stochastic algorithm that has sustained life for billions of years and created intelligence from nothing. I will continue adding creative and computational value as a programmer. Probably.
